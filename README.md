**Structura: Algorithms & Data Structures**
=========================================

Overview
--------

**Structura: Algorithms & Data Structures** is a beginner-friendly web app built with Streamlit and Python. It serves as an educational tool to help users learn and explore various data structures and algorithms in a simple, interactive way. By selecting a topic from dropdown menus, users can view definitions, usages, and examples of essential data structures and algorithms, with code examples included.

Features
--------

*   **Data Structure Explanations**: Learn about arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables with simple definitions, use cases, and Python examples.
    
*   **Algorithm Insights**: Explore foundational algorithms such as searching, sorting, recursion, and graph algorithms with code samples.
    
*   **Interactive Code Display**: See Python code examples directly in the app for each topic.
    
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate dropdown menus for selecting topics and viewing content.
